This is the official documentation for Flame. Flame is a c++ machine learning
library build on top of PyTorch. It's puprpose is primarily to implement pose
estimation and object detection models with good performance, in a way which
allows for low inference times which are required for real-time applications.
This is particularly important for mobile.

I hope that this can also be used a resource for how to use the PyTorch c++ API.
